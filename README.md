# TASK - Feedback Form Application

## Installation Steps:

1. Install nodejs and npm on your device.
2. Clone the repository to your local system.
3. In the root folder, create a '.env' file
4. Create a MongoDB Atlas server and get the MongoDB uri
5. Add env variables as "MONGO_URI" to the .env file
6. Add a PORT variable and JWT_SECRET variable too.
7. Set PORT = 5000
8. Set JWT_SECRET as a string of your choice.
9. Open up the command terminal from the root directory and type `npm start` to start the backend server.


The backend server works but the application doesn't have a working frontend.
